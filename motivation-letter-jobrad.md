Hello there!

I'm writing to express my interest in the Senior Backend Developer position at JobRad.
I came to know about this position through lovely chats that I had with Jan Engler (at Python and Docker meetups and then at Cafe Kurbel) and Matthias Chlechowitz.

My JobRad journey started 2 years ago when I applied and got an offer from Jodel before my first interview. I then tried to organize a Docker meetup there, but it
faced some difficulties. Fast-forward to two months ago, I attended a Python meetup at JobRad and as there was a speaker slot available, I gave a talk as well. It led to
the Docker meetup finally happening at JobRad's awesome campus, and to the talks with Jan as I had just left Haufe Akademie.

I'm glad to see it's finally working out and we can pick up from where we left two years ago.
