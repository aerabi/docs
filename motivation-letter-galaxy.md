Hi Björn,

how are you? Long time no see!

I am writing to you to express my interest in the Systems Engineer / DevOps Engineer position at Galaxy.
If you remember, we worked together briefly back in 2017. I was studying CS at the time, and we had a chat at the Seepark about Docker Swarm.

What has changed in the past 7 years:

- I gained 7 years of experience in software and site reliability engineering. And I finished my masters.
- Docker Swarm was sold to Mirantis, and Kubernetes became the de facto standard for container orchestration. And I became a Docker Captain.
- I worked at Picnic (in Amsterdam), Jodel (in Berlin), and AppTec (in Freiburg), among others.
- At Jodel, I helped migrate the infrastructure from bare-metal Kubernetes to AWS with Terraform.
- At AppTec, I introduced git and built the work culture and CI/CD pipelines from ground up.
- Galaxy gained more popularity, and started using more modern technologies like Terraform and GitHub Actions.

What makes me a fit for this position:

- I have been using Linux for the past 10 years. 
- I'm a git advocate, and I'm blogging on it. Look it up! [aerabi.medium.com](https://aerabi.medium.com)
- My middle name is "Dockerizer". I containerized the shit out of every project I got my hands on.

Hope to see you soon!

Best,  
Mohammad-Ali
